This is a vibecoded AI slop project to replace an absurd $240 PDF editor (Adobe Acrobat, WTF?), which for some reason has a site on adobe that is practically unfunctional.
- I am suprised the application it output wasn't terrible garbage.
- Maybe I'll tell it to create a javascript only page too and host it here.
## Notes
- Thumbnails are generated at import time; large PDFs may take a moment.
- Export requires at least one included page.
- If you have very large PDFs, consider running from a terminal to see status messages.
